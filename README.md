# classification-fairness
UC Santa Cruz-Fall 2023 Quarter Independent Study
Advised by Luca de Alfaro

Using Python libraries to develop algorithms for improved classification fairness. 
Conducted literature reviews on analysis of past research works on decision tree divergence issues. 
Implemented a decision tree algorithm on predicting recidivity to improve classification fairness. Implementated false positive prediction task accuracy and false positive divergence calculations via Google Collab.
The implementation of a decision tree algorithm is under Notebooks/DivExplorerExample.ipynb.
